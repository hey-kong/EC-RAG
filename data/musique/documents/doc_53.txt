Passage 2:
Champlain, Quebec
Champlain is a municipality in the province of Quebec, Canada.  It is located in Les Chenaux Regional County Municipality and the administrative region the Mauricie, on the north shore of St. Lawrence River. Champlain is also part of the metropolitan area of Trois-Rivières.
Champlain is a member of the Association of the Most Beautiful Villages of Quebec.

Origin of the place name
In 1632, Samuel de Champlain, founder of New France, gave his name to the Champlain River.  The Commission de toponymie du Québec has noted a "popular version" of the origin of the name, which suggests that Champlain gave the area its name because, "amazed by the beauty of the place, [he] exclaimed to himself, 'What a beautiful flat plain', from the Latin campus planus, 'flat field'."  However, the Commission concludes that it is certain that Champlain named the area after himself, as his contemporary record indicates that he named the river the "Rivière de Champlain".The deed of the seigniory of Champlain, dated April 8, 1664, does not name the seigniory. The deed only mentions that the granted land extended "from the Champlain River following the said river [Saint Lawrence] to the said Trois-Rivières". It appears that it was the first seigneur, Étienne Pézard de la Touche, who gave the name of "Champlain" to the seigniory, then to the parish.By 1668, the documents relating to the residents of Champlain mention they live in "La Touche-Champlain", or simply "Champlain" from 1669 onwards. In 1684, the area was already well known as Champlain, demonstrated when Bishop Laval, finally giving the official titles of the parish twenty years after its foundation, referred to: "the place commonly called Champlain".As for the family name of the seigneurs, by 1680 the first seigneur referred to himself as La Touche-Champlain, and Pézard Champlain by 1693. His successor referred to himself as Pézard Latouche-Champlain by 1702.In 1829 the name was used for the electoral district for the area in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, and in 1841, the electoral district for the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada.  The name was given to the municipality in 1845, and then to the federal and provincial electoral districts in 1867.

History
Beginnings of French settlement
The Champlain municipality lies on the territory of the former seigniories of Marsolet and l'Arbre-à-la-Croix, both granted on April 5, 1644, and the seigniory of Champlain, granted on August 8, 1664.
The first French occupants of Champlain settled in 1664 or 1665. There had been a first attempt to settle on land granted August 16, 1643, but the distance from other settlements and the Iroquois threat discouraged settlement. In 1664 or 1665, the first settlers established settlements in the land of the seigniory of Champlain. The following year, in 1666, concessions were granted in the seigniory of Hertel, and in 1667 in the seigniory of Marsolet. Some of the first families came from Trois-Rivières, such as the families of Antoine Desrosiers, François Chorel and Pierre Dandonneau.

Minsk Region
Minsk Region, also known as Minsk Oblast or Minsk Voblasts (Belarusian: Мі́нская во́бласць, romanized: Minskaja voblasć, IPA: [ˈmʲinskaja ˈvobɫasʲtsʲ]; Russian: Минская о́бласть, romanized: Minskaya oblast), is one of the regions of Belarus. Its administrative center is Minsk, although it is a separate administrative territorial entity of Belarus. As of 2011, the region's population is 1,411,500.

Geography
Minsk Region covers a total of 39,900 km2, about 19.44% of the national total area. Lake Narach, the largest lake in the country, is located in the northern part of the region. There are four other large lakes in this region: Svir (8th largest), Myadel (11th largest), Syalyava (14th largest) and Myastro (15th largest). It is the only region of Belarus whose border is not part of the international border of Belarus.

History
Beginning the 10th century, the territory of the current Minsk Region was part of Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk, and later it was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the unification of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the territory became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
In 1793, as a result of the second partition of Polish territory, the area was annexed by Russia as the Minsk Region. During the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the Civil War, the western part was annexed to Poland in 1921, while the east became Soviet Belarus.
The Minsk region was established on 15 January 1938, based on the amendment of the Constitutional Law of the USSR. As of 20 February 1938, the area included 20 districts.  Following the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939, the former Eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic were annexed in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact partitioning Poland and added to the Minsk Region.
On 20 September 1944, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck were removed from the Minsk region and transferred to the newly formed Bobruisk Region.
On 8 January 1954, by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Nesvizhski and Stolbtsovsky districts from the abolished Baranovichi Region, as well as the Glusk, Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck from the abolished Bobruisk Region, were added to the Minsk Region.
In 1960, following the abolition of Molodechno Region, its southern part became the northern part of the Minsk Region.

Tourism
The number of travel agencies in Minsk Region grew from twelve in 2000 to seventy in 2010. The most popular tourist destinations of the region are Zaslavskoye Lake, the Zhdanovichi area which has health resorts, Nesvizh Palace and its surroundings, as well as the alpine ski resorts of Logoysk and Silichi.

Passage 10:
Golestan Province
Golestan province (Persian: استان گلستان, (Golestân), Ostâne Golestân) is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, located in the northeast of the country and southeast of the Caspian Sea. Its capital is Gorgan, formerly called Esterabad until 1937. Golestan was split off from Mazandaran province in 1997.
The province was made a part of Region 1 upon the division of the provinces into 5 regions, solely for coordination and development purposes, on 22 June 2014. Majority of its population are Sunni Muslims.At the 2006 census, the province's population was 1,593,055 in 379,354 households. The following census in 2011 showed an increase in population to 1,777,014 in 482,842 households. At the most recent census conducted in 2016, the population had risen to 1,868,819 in 550,249 households.

Etymology
Gulistan, Golestan, or Golastan translates to "gul-" meaning "flower" and "-stan" meaning "land" or "region." Golestan, therefore, literally means "land of flowers" in Iranian languages (e.g., Persian, Kurdish, and Mazandarani.  This is a common toponym in countries with Persian linguistic roots (see Gulistan).
The capital of Gorgan derives its name from a wider region known historically as Gorgân (گرگان), Middle Persian Gurgān, and Old Persian Varkāna (in the Behistun Inscription) meaning "land of wolves". This is also the root of the Ancient Greek Ὑρκανία (Hyrkanía) and Latin Hyrcania.  Wild wolves are still found in Golestan.

History
Human settlements in this area date back to 10,000 BC. Evidence of the ancient city of Jorjan can still be seen near the current city of Gonbad-e Kavus. It was an important city of Persia located on the Silk Road.
Under the Achaemenid Iran, it seems to have been administered as a sub-province of Parthia and is not named separately in the provincial lists of Darius and Xerxes. The Hyrcanians, however, under the leadership of Megapanus, are mentioned by Herodotus in his list of Xerxes' army during the invasion of Greece.

Administrative divisions
Cities
According to the 2016 census, 1,015,774 people (over 54% of the population of Golestan province) live in the following cities: Aliabad-e Katul 52,838, Anbar Olum 7,003, Aqqala 35,116, Azadshahr 43,760, Bandar Torkaman 53,970, Bandar-e Gaz 20,742, Daland 20,754, Faraqi 5,777, Fazelabad 19,461, Galikash 23,394, Gomishan 19,191, Gonbad-e Kavus 151,910, Gorgan 350,676, Incheh Borun 2,494, Jelin 7,417, Kalaleh 36,176, Khan Bebin 10,878, Kordkuy 39,881, Maraveh Tappeh 8,671, Mazraeh 4,009, Minudasht 30,085, Neginshahr 8,138, Now Deh Khanduz 2,989, Now Kandeh 6,650, Ramian 12,426, Sangdevin 4,203, Sarkhon Kalateh 7,589, Siminshahr 17,205, and Tatar-e Olya 4,782.

Demographics
In 2006, the Ministry of Education of Iran estimated the ethnic breakdown of the province to be:

Turkmens: 34.20%
Mazandaranis: 30.40%
Sistanis & Persians: 14.90%
Baluchis: 10.90%
Qizilbash: 7.30%
Others (including Azeris, Kazakhs, Kurds, Armenians and Georgians): 2.3%Apparently, the Mazandaranis who inhabit the foothills all the way to Shah Pasand were subsumed under the rubric "Persian" by this official statistics.
The Persians/Mazandaranis are considered by nearly all inhabitants of the province to be "the old natives" while all others are considered ethnic immigrants in the past.
Most Mazandaranis live in Gorgan, Ali Abad, Kordkuy, Bandar-e Gaz and Gonbad-e Kavus. They speak Mazanderani language.The Turkmens reside in the north of the province, a plain called Turkmen Sahra. From the 15th century, these formerly nomadic people have lived in this area, the main cities, of which are Gonbad-e Kavus and Bandar Torkaman. Turkmens are Sunni Muslim. They are a sizable minority in cities such as Gorgan, Ali Abad, Kalaleh and many eastern townships.
Azeris and the Qizilbash predate the Turkmen by centuries and have in time become completely Shia, and therefore, culturally associate with the Persians and other Shias.
The Sistani Persians and the Baluch are relatively of recent arrival and date back to the early 20th century. They are still arriving in the area in some numbers due to the lasting drought in their home areas of Sistan.
The people of Kordkuy are originally from the Kurdish areas of west Iran, Kermanshah and Kurdistan provinces. They belong to the Kord-rostami tribe and are also found in significant numbers in other cities like Gorgan and Bandare Gaz.
Other ethnic groups such as Kazakhs, Kurds, Georgians, and Armenians also reside in this area, and have preserved their traditions and rituals.
A small minority of Baháʼí Faith also live in Golestan (in Shahpasand).

Culture
The world's tallest brick structure of its kind, the Gonbad-e Qabus tower, stands in this province.

Climate and geography
Golestan enjoys mild weather and a temperate climate most of the year. Geographically, it is divided into two sections: The plains, and the mountains of the Alborz range. In the eastern Alborz section, the direction of mountains faces northeast and gradually decreases in height. The highest point of the province is Shavar, with a height of 3,945 meters. Two of the main rivers are the Gharasu and Gorganrud.

Golestan National Park
Golestan National Park in northern Iran is faced with the construction of a road through the forest, allegedly for the ease of traffic for the villagers and woodmen but at the expense of losing the only national park in Iran throughout which a range of different climates (humidity near the Caspian Sea and desert farther south) is spread.
Golestan National Park is Iran's biggest national park which spans three provinces, Golestan, Mazandaran and North Khorasan. Surprisingly, the authorities ignore repeated calls by experts to construct such roads around, instead of through, the forests, which in this way would no longer threaten the animal and plant life.

Sabin, Wisconsin
Sabin is an unincorporated community in the Town of Sylvan, Richland County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located at the intersection of County Highway E and Robbson Drive.

History
Sabin was settled in the 1850s and named for Dr. Eli Sabin, one of the first settlers. Sabin lies near the head waters of Mill Creek, known originally as Eagle Creek or Eagle River. In early days the only access to Sabin was a rough road that followed the creek about 20 miles (30 km) south to its mouth on the Wisconsin River at Orion.
Sabin had two churches.  The Disciples or Christian Church of Sabin was organized in 1858 and erected a frame building about 1872. This building was replaced with a new building seating about 400 in 1904. Baptisms were performed in Mill Creek during the summer and in the cheese factory during the winter. The last service in the Christian Church was December 11, 1966, and the building was burned on April 25, 1979. The other church was the Mt. Tabor Methodist Church for which land was deeded in 1868. The local Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge contributed to the erection of this church and used it for their meetings. This church no longer exists but it was holding services as late as 1900. The Mt. Tabor Methodist Church stood next to the Mt Tabor Cemetery, which received its first burials in the 1860s and remains in use for new burials.
The first school building at Sabin was a log structure erected in 1856. It burned down in 1880 and was replaced the following year by a frame building. This building burned in 1917 and was replaced by another frame structure which burned down in 1929 and was replaced by a brick school house which still stands, although it ceased to be used as a school in 1962. The Sabin Livewires 4-H club has been active in the community since 1946.
There was a cheese factory in Sabin at least as early as 1901, and through a succession of ownership, cheesemakers, and at least three buildings, cheese was made in Sabin until 1960. The second cheese factory, constructed about 1915, was a two-story structure with the factory on the first floor and a large hall and kitchen on the second floor used for community gatherings. Sabin had its own post office from 1886 to 1911. Through several changes of ownership and location, there was a general store in Sabin from before 1896 until 1966. In the 1920s the Jones Lumber Company of Appleton, Wisconsin operated a saw mill at Sabin that produced 1,500,000 board feet (4,000 m3) of lumber in six years.

Etymology
Gulistan, Golestan, or Golastan translates to "gul-" meaning "flower" and "-stan" meaning "land" or "region." Golestan, therefore, literally means "land of flowers" in Iranian languages (e.g., Persian, Kurdish, and Mazandarani.  This is a common toponym in countries with Persian linguistic roots (see Gulistan).
The capital of Gorgan derives its name from a wider region known historically as Gorgân (گرگان), Middle Persian Gurgān, and Old Persian Varkāna (in the Behistun Inscription) meaning "land of wolves". This is also the root of the Ancient Greek Ὑρκανία (Hyrkanía) and Latin Hyrcania.  Wild wolves are still found in Golestan.

History
Human settlements in this area date back to 10,000 BC. Evidence of the ancient city of Jorjan can still be seen near the current city of Gonbad-e Kavus. It was an important city of Persia located on the Silk Road.
Under the Achaemenid Iran, it seems to have been administered as a sub-province of Parthia and is not named separately in the provincial lists of Darius and Xerxes. The Hyrcanians, however, under the leadership of Megapanus, are mentioned by Herodotus in his list of Xerxes' army during the invasion of Greece.

Demographics
In 2006, the Ministry of Education of Iran estimated the ethnic breakdown of the province to be:

Turkmens: 34.20%
Mazandaranis: 30.40%
Sistanis & Persians: 14.90%
Baluchis: 10.90%
Qizilbash: 7.30%
Others (including Azeris, Kazakhs, Kurds, Armenians and Georgians): 2.3%Apparently, the Mazandaranis who inhabit the foothills all the way to Shah Pasand were subsumed under the rubric "Persian" by this official statistics.
The Persians/Mazandaranis are considered by nearly all inhabitants of the province to be "the old natives" while all others are considered ethnic immigrants in the past.
Most Mazandaranis live in Gorgan, Ali Abad, Kordkuy, Bandar-e Gaz and Gonbad-e Kavus. They speak Mazanderani language.The Turkmens reside in the north of the province, a plain called Turkmen Sahra. From the 15th century, these formerly nomadic people have lived in this area, the main cities, of which are Gonbad-e Kavus and Bandar Torkaman. Turkmens are Sunni Muslim. They are a sizable minority in cities such as Gorgan, Ali Abad, Kalaleh and many eastern townships.
Azeris and the Qizilbash predate the Turkmen by centuries and have in time become completely Shia, and therefore, culturally associate with the Persians and other Shias.
The Sistani Persians and the Baluch are relatively of recent arrival and date back to the early 20th century. They are still arriving in the area in some numbers due to the lasting drought in their home areas of Sistan.
The people of Kordkuy are originally from the Kurdish areas of west Iran, Kermanshah and Kurdistan provinces. They belong to the Kord-rostami tribe and are also found in significant numbers in other cities like Gorgan and Bandare Gaz.
Other ethnic groups such as Kazakhs, Kurds, Georgians, and Armenians also reside in this area, and have preserved their traditions and rituals.
A small minority of Baháʼí Faith also live in Golestan (in Shahpasand).

Climate and geography
Golestan enjoys mild weather and a temperate climate most of the year. Geographically, it is divided into two sections: The plains, and the mountains of the Alborz range. In the eastern Alborz section, the direction of mountains faces northeast and gradually decreases in height. The highest point of the province is Shavar, with a height of 3,945 meters. Two of the main rivers are the Gharasu and Gorganrud.

Golestan National Park
Golestan National Park in northern Iran is faced with the construction of a road through the forest, allegedly for the ease of traffic for the villagers and woodmen but at the expense of losing the only national park in Iran throughout which a range of different climates (humidity near the Caspian Sea and desert farther south) is spread.
Golestan National Park is Iran's biggest national park which spans three provinces, Golestan, Mazandaran and North Khorasan. Surprisingly, the authorities ignore repeated calls by experts to construct such roads around, instead of through, the forests, which in this way would no longer threaten the animal and plant life.
