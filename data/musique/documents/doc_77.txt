Nicholas Girod
Nicolas Girod (French spelling) or Nicholas Girod (April 1751—September 1840) was the fifth mayor of New Orleans, from late in 1812 to September 4, 1815. He was the first mayor of the city after Louisiana entered into the Union as a state.

Biography
Nicolas Girod, born into a prominent family in Savoy, migrated to Spanish Louisiana in the late 1770s with brother Claude François (1752-1813) and brother-in-law Andre-Marie Quetant and was later joined by brother Jean François (1773-1850). He prospered as a commission merchant and owner of extensive property in New Orleans, especially in the American quarter. They conducted commercial enterprises with area planters in what was known as the commission or factorage business. The Girods kept a wholesale and retail store in the vicinity of the levee landing, which in later years was transferred to the building at the corner of Chartres and St. Louis streets. He owned a large number of properties in the area of today's Central Business District, in the vicinity of Girod Street.In 1812, He was the first regularly-elected mayor of New Orleans after Louisiana's admission to the Union. He was initially elected on September 21, 1812. Girod took office on November 5 of that year and served until September 4, 1814; at which date he was re-elected, resigning on September 4, 1815. He was briefly out of office in his first year, most likely due to illness, before retaking his position.
It was during his time in office that The War of 1812 broke out, and he prepared the city to defend itself against a British invasion force. He welcomed in General Andrew Jackson who declared martial law upon entering New Orleans in December 1814, having marched overland from present-day southern Alabama and then crossing Lake Pontchartrain. He ruled over the city until ending martial law in March 1815. After the Battle of New Orleans, Girod retired from politics and returned to manage his many businesses.Girod was a noted philanthropist. Among other provisions in his 1837 holographic will, he left a bon (obligation) of $100,000 to be applied to the construction of a facility in Orleans Parish for the housing and care of Louisiana's French orphans. Other institutions and individuals were recipients under this will, including Charity Hospital, $30,000.Nicolas Girod died on September 1, 1840, at his home located on the corner of Chartres and St. Louis streets. Both New Orleans and Mandeville, Louisiana, have a Girod Street, named in Nicolas Girod's honor. He never married and had no children.

Plot to free Napoleon
New Orleans was full of excitement in the spring of 1821 when Girod remodeled and furnished a house he owned on Chartres Street, that he inherited from Claude Francois Girod, which is now known as the Napoleon house. Girod was one of the prominent financial sponsors of a plan to rescue Napoleon Bonaparte from his exile in Saint Helena, and bring him back to live in New Orleans at the Napoleon house. The ship Seraphine was constructed and would sail out on its mission commanded by Capt. Bossier and Louisiana pirate Dominique You. The expedition set sail, but returned when signaled by a French merchantman that Napoleon had died May 5, 1821.

Portage, Wisconsin
Portage is a city in and the county seat of Columbia County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 10,581 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Columbia County. The city is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Portage was named for the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway, a portage between the Fox River and the Wisconsin River, which was recognized by Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet during their discovery of a route to the Mississippi River in 1673. The city's slogan is "Where the North Begins."

History
The Native American tribes that once lived here, and later the European traders and settlers, took advantage of the lowlands between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers as a natural "portage". This is reflected in indigenous names for the town, such as the Menominee name Kahkāmohnakaneh, which means "at the short cut". In May 1673, Jacques Marquette joined the expedition of Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian explorer, to find the Mississippi River. They departed from St. Ignace on May 17, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry (Métis). They followed Lake Michigan to Green Bay and up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters. From there, they were told to portage their canoes a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak plains to the Wisconsin River. Later, French fur traders described the place as "le portage", which eventually lent itself to the name of the community. As a portage, this community developed as a center of commerce and trade; later, a canal was constructed to facilitate this trade. When the railroads came through, the community continued in this role.
Portage emerged at this place because of its unique position along the one and a half mile strip of marshy floodplain between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. By the end of the 17th century, the Fox-Wisconsin waterway, linked at The Portage, served as the major fur trade thoroughfare between Green Bay and Prairie du Chien. It was not until the 1780s and 1790s that traders built their posts and warehouses at each end of The Portage.  In the early 19th century Portage was primarily populated by Métis.  In 1828, the federal government recognized the strategic economic importance of The Portage and built Fort Winnebago at the Fox River end. After 15 years of controversy, Winnebago settlement (now Portage) won the county seat in 1851.  The community incorporated as Portage City in 1854.
The Portage business district lies along a hill that overlooks the Portage Canal. The buildings now in the city's downtown were once part of a bustling, urban commercial center serving a large region across north central Wisconsin. The building of the city paralleled its commercial prominence between the end of the American Civil War and the second decade of the 20th century.

Geography
Portage lies in the Wisconsin River valley. The city is surrounded by prairies and grasslands. Approximately three miles (5 km) west of the city are the Baraboo bluffs.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.62 square miles (24.92 km2), of which, 8.82 square miles (22.84 km2) is land and 0.80 square miles (2.07 km2) is water. The location of the town at the split of the Wisconsin and Fox river is what gives it the name "Portage", which means carrying a boat of its cargo between two navigable waters. In addition to the rivers, the city has access to Swan Lake and Silver Lake.

Cityscape
When Portage was first established, the streets were laid out on a traditional grid system. Today, the streets of the outlying city are contorted as a result of the many marshes and lowlands that run through much of Columbia County. The northern side of the city thus looks different from the central city, with the organized grid street system giving way to a more suburban streetscape with a lower housing density.
The city has two commercial areas. One is the downtown historic district, which features several small boutique shops and restaurants; the other is the Northridge commercial area that features big box stores. In the summer of 2007, the Portage Canal was cleaned up and now features a bike path that runs alongside part of it. In the summer of 2008, the main downtown street was redone. Historical landmarks of the city include the Museum at the Portage, the Indian Agency house, and the Surgeons Quarters.

Passage 8:
Ian North
Ian North (March 24, 1952 – February 28, 2021) was an American musician, producer, and painter known for being part of the bohemian punk movement in United States with his power pop band Milk 'N' Cookies.

Early life and career
Ian North was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States. He grew up in Long Island. He received his first guitar at age 12, but being virtually tone deaf, could not play any songs other than those he composed. In 1970, he slowly started to get serious about his artwork.

Milk 'N' Cookies
In 1973, North formed a power pop and glam outfit called Milk 'N' Cookies along with Justin Strauss on vocals, Jay Weiss (replaced by Sal Maida, later in Roxy Music and Sparks) on bass and Mike Ruiz on drums (later in Paul Collins' Beat). While the album's release was initially delayed and largely ignored upon release, it has subsequently become a cult classic. After its reissue in 2005, the band headlined the Radio Heartbeat festival in 2007 without North. As younger bands that now claim Milk 'n' Cookies as an influence have gained in popularity, like Nobunny and Cheap Time, the band has garnered even more attention. In 2016, Captured Tracks released a 3xLP Milk 'N' Cookies boxset which included a book of liners featuring notes by members of Sonic Youth, Ramones, and Blondie.

British punk and new wave scene: Radio and Neo
After the split of Milk 'N' Cookies, North moved to England and formed Radio with Sparks bassist Martin Gordon and the Simon brothers, Paul and Robert. That group transformed to Neo after Gordon's departure (he joined Radio Stars) and changed line-ups, with North being the only remaining member until 1979, when his visa ended and he returned to New York. The same year, twelve Neo tracks were released in Britain by Aura Records as a North solo album, titled Neo.

Return to US and solo career
Back in New York, North took to newly affordable synth technology and recording equipment, first on his debut full-length album as a solo artist, My Girlfriend's Dead, and then on his Rape of the Orchids EP. During this time he also produced material for The Fast; he also filled in as the band's bassist in the music videos for their songs "Kids Just Wanna Dance" and "Love Me Like a Locomotive". From 1983 to 1993, North worked sporadically on the album Torch Songs & Arson. While the label originally slated to release the album folded in the decade over which it was created, it has since been made available for free download. In 2009, North ended the longest period of musical inactivity in his life, releasing the 12-song album, E Z Listening For Suicides, under the moniker "Darkjet".

Death
North died in Sarasota Florida following complications from a heart attack on February 28, 2021. He is survived by his wife of 20 years, Mooshi Chapel and four children, including artist Sammy thrashLife.
