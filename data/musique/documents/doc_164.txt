Passage 1:
WNDE
WNDE (1260 AM) is a commercial radio station in Indianapolis, Indiana.  It is owned by iHeartMedia with the broadcast license held by iHM Licenses, LLC. WNDE broadcasts a sports radio format, with some afternoon talk programs, including The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show.
WNDE is powered at 5,000 watts.  By day, it uses a non-directional antenna.  But at night, to protect other stations on 1260 AM from interference, it switches to a directional antenna with a three-tower array.  The transmitter is off Fall Creek Road in Indianapolis.  Programming is also heard on the HD Radio digital subchannel of co-owned WFBQ 94.7 FM.

History
WFBM
The station signed on as WFBM on October 23, 1924.  It is the oldest radio station still operating in Indianapolis, and third oldest in the state of Indiana.  It was started by the Merchants Heating & Light Co., later Indianapolis Power & Light.  In its early years, it broadcast on 1130 kilocycles.  In 1927, it moved to 1330 kHz, then to 1090 kHz in 1928, and to 1230 kHz in 1929.  It arrived at its current frequency after the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) in 1941, when all stations in the United States at 1230 kHz were moved to 1260 kHz.
In 1949, WFBM-TV (now WRTV) went on the air in time to broadcast the 1949 Indianapolis 500 (May 30, 1949).  The WFBM "family" grew on November 26, 1959, when WFBM-FM went on the air at 94.7 MHz (now WFBQ).  In 1957, WFBM-AM-FM-TV were sold to Time-Life, Inc.  McGraw-Hill bought the stations in 1972, and almost immediately put the radio stations on the market.  The WFBM stations had been grandfathered when the FCC banned common ownership of television and radio stations, but lost that protection with the McGraw-Hill purchase.

WNDE
In 1973, WFBM became WNDE, followed by WFBM-FM becoming WFBQ in Spring 1974.  The WNDE call letters were chosen as the letters "NDE" phonetically sound like "Indy".Through much of the 1960s and 70s, WNDE had a Top 40 format, using the identifier "Windy Twelve Sixty."  WNDE and 1310 WIFE (now WTLC) had a spirited competition for youthful Top 40 listeners.  But in the 1980s, contemporary music listening switched to the FM dial.  WNDE needed to find a new format and eventually it switched to Sports Radio.

Sports Radio
WNDE has been a Fox Sports Radio network affiliate since 2002. It had previously been an ESPN Radio affiliate on two occasions.  In September 2012, the network switched from Fox Sports Radio to NBC Sports Radio in the 10 p.m.-5 a.m. weekday hours, remaining with Fox in other dayparts.  Former hosts of the afternoon drive local show include former WISH-TV sports anchor and Hoosier Millionaire host Mark Patrick, the team of Tim Bragg & Bill Benner, Indiana Pacers announcer Mark Boyle, JMV (John Michael Vincent, currently with WFNI), IndyCar Radio announcer Jake Query, and Derek Schultz.

On July 7, 2015, WNDE added W248AW, an FM translator on 97.5 MHz. On July 22, 2019, the translator ended its simulcast. The next month, iHeart announced it was returning the translator originally owned by Christian radio company Educational Media Foundation back to that organization as part of a translator trade.

Programming
Most programming comes from the Fox Sports Radio network.  In late mornings, it carries Premiere Networks' The Dan Patrick Show.  And unusual for a sports radio station, it carries The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show from noon to 3 p.m. weekdays.  Travis & Sexton are followed by a two-hour financial talk show.  Sports programming resumes at 5 p.m. on weekdays.
WNDE's long-running local afternoon drive time show, "Query & Schultz", hosted by Jake Query and Derek Schultz, aired from 2011 to 2020. Query and Schultz were released in January 2020 as part of iHeart's cut backs. The 2020 iHeartRadio reduction in force (RIF) impacted over 1,000 employees across the USA. WNDE has not had a local sportstalk show in any daypart since.
On July 6, 2015, WNDE became the Indianapolis outlet for The Rush Limbaugh Show, which had been on WIBC for over two decades but whose carriage was ended for local programming.  Coinciding with iHeart taking the show in-house to WNDE (the only choice it had locally due to incompatible music formats on iHeart's three other FM stations in the market), the company also acquired FM translator station W248AW 97.5 FM from the Educational Media Foundation to simulcast WNDE. The surrounding sports format did not change.  Limbaugh began airing on WNDE the same day as the station rebranded to "Fox Sports 97.5." That FM simulcast ended in 2019 and WNDE became "Fox Sports 1260" (named for the AM frequency).  When Limbaugh died in 2020 and Travis & Sexton succeeded him in the time slot, WNDE continued carrying the replacement program.
WNDE is the Indianapolis outlet for Purdue University football and men's basketball, sharing flagship status with Lafayette's WAZY.  It also airs Westwood One's NFL and NCAA football and basketball coverage. After years of broadcasting Cincinnati Reds baseball, WNDE was briefly a part of the Chicago Cubs network in 2009 and 2010.  In 2011, WNDE dropped NASCAR programming after many years, and began broadcasting Indianapolis Indians baseball.

It is owned by Cumulus Media, with studios in Nashville's Music Row district.  Most of its daytime schedule has local hosts, with programming from Fox Sports Radio heard nights and weekends.
WGFX has an effective radiated power of 58,000 watts.  The transmitter is on Blevins Road off Interstate 24 in Whites Creek, Tennessee, amid the towers for other Nashville-area FM and TV stations.

History
Early years
The station signed on as WFMG-FM on December 1, 1960, in Gallatin, Tennessee, about 30 miles (47 km) northeast of Nashville, with a big band format. The station was started by Ellis F. Jones Jr. The studio and transmitter location was located on North Water Street on Gallatin's Public Square. The transmitter power was 8.2 KW ERP according to FCC Records. In 1965, the station's studio and transmitter site was moved 5.1 miles north of the City of Gallatin to a location known as "Music Mountain". In 1971, Sumner Country Broadcasting Co., which owned WHIN in Gallatin, purchased WFMG and changed call letters to WHIN-FM. During the early years of WHIN-FM, the format was easy listening. In 1974, the station switched to an all oldies format. In July 1978, WHIN-FM flipped formats to contemporary hit radio (CHR). Just over one month later, the call letters were changed to WWKX using the moniker KX 104 FM.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station was very popular and featured morning DJ Coyote McCloud. Its 100,000 watt signal broadcasting from "Music Mountain", one of the highest points on the northern Highland Rim north of Gallatin and the site of several broadcasting facilities, boomed far into the rural areas of northern Tennessee and southern Kentucky. By the mid-1980s, KX 104 was faced with competition from two new area CHRs, "96 Kiss" (WZKS, now WCJK) and "Y107" (WYHY, now WRVW). Additionally, McCloud defected to WYHY in 1985 to host its morning show. To try to differentiate itself, WWKX segued into a rock-leaning Top 40 format calling itself Rock Hits 104, Kicks FM. This move proved unfruitful, and the station returned to mainstream CHR a year later in 1986. Faced with the success of Y107, this would not last.

Classic Rock
In the summer of 1987, WWKX moved its tower from Music Mountain into Nashville and downgraded power, noticeably affecting signal strength in rural areas north of the city. The call letters changed to WGFX on August 13, 1987 and the moniker became 104.5 The Fox with a classic rock format.In the late 1980s, Dick Broadcasting Company (DBC) took over operations of the station through a local marketing agreement (LMA), and paired it with its popular rock and roll station WKDF to form "Nashville's Rock Network". In the early 1990s, the station became known as "Arrow 104.5" (with Arrow originally standing for "All Rock n' Roll Oldies"). This format was somewhat successful and endured until the late 1990s.
The station was purchased outright by Dick Broadcasting Company following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which, in part, loosened broadcast ownership rules. 
Shortly after the acquisition, Dick Broadcasting entered into an agreement with SFX Broadcasting, the then-owner of WLAC-FM, to trade the intellectual property of the stations. The trade, to have taken place February 2, 1998, would have moved WLAC-FM's adult contemporary format to 104.5 FM, and moved WGFX's classic rock format to 105.9 under SFX ownership. However, when the agreement fell apart, SFX converted WLAC-FM to a classic rock format of its own, changed the call letters to WNRQ, and began to compete directly with WGFX.

Rhythmic Oldies
Responding to the early ratings success of WNRQ, WGFX reformatted to rhythmic oldies as "Jammin' Oldies 104.5", on December 11, 1998, but quickly changed its name to "Groovin' Hits 104.5" after a brief trademark dispute.In early 1999, WGFX was slated to convert to a country music outlet built around local air personality Carl P. Mayfield. Dick Broadcasting purchased advertising in other media promoting Mayfield's impending debut on 104.5 WGFX. However, the company ultimately succumbed to Mayfield's repeated demands that the format be installed on the stronger-signalled WKDF, leaving WGFX to continue broadcasting rhythmic oldies.

Classic Hits
In January 2000, the station reverted to a classic hits format, focusing mainly on 1970s music. First known as simply "The New 104 — That '70s Station", it became "The New 104 — The Core" a few months later, and was positioned as a lighter alternative to WNRQ.
Citadel Broadcasting purchased the station (along with all of DBC's assets outside the Greenville, South Carolina market) in September 2000.  In the summer of 2002, the station broadened its playlist to include music from 1980s, and changed its name to "Rockin' Hits 104.5 WGFX", marking the only time the station has used those call letters in its branding.

Sports 104.5 The Zone
The All Sports format began on August 11, 2003, with the station renamed "104.5 The Zone."  Management hired popular personalities George Plaster, Willy Daunic and Darren McFarland away from Cumulus Media station WWTN (99.7 FM). However, because of litigation surrounding a contract dispute, Plaster did not appear on the station until two months after its launch.
In the early days of the Zone, the station had a heavy focus on local news, and featured general-interest talk on weekdays from 6am-Noon, with sports in all other dayparts. For the first three weeks of the talk format, the station broadcast "The Rick and Bubba Show" (a holdover from the previous "Rockin' Hits" format). It then brought over Mayfield's "Carl P. & The P-Team" show from WKDF, where it had been replaced in morning drive. Following Mayfield's exit in December 2003, the station began broadcasting "The Wake-Up Zone" in early mornings, featuring Mayfield's supporting cast, but led by Nashville music industry executive Charlie Monk. Popular Knoxville morning talk personality Hallerin Hilton Hill also hosted a 2-hour version of his show for the Nashville market in the late morning slot.
Over the course of 18 months, the station migrated to 24/7 sports talk. Hill's show was canceled, and "The Wake-Up Zone" was converted to a sports-focused show, replacing Charlie Monk & Mike Donegan with Kevin Ingram and retired Titans tight end Frank Wycheck. They joined Mark Howard, who continued with the show from its previous iteration. The trio of Ingram, Howard and Wycheck continued on the show until 2017, when Wycheck left the show and was replaced with another former Titans star, Blaine Bishop.

Titans and Volunteers Football
WGFX was the flagship station for the Tennessee Oilers/Titans of the National Football League from 1997 until the completion of the 2001 season, when the rights were shifted to WGFX's sister station, WKDF. (WGFX returned as an "affiliate" station of the team's network for the 2004 season only). WGFX also aired the franchise's games in 1996, the final year the team was located in Houston, Texas. WGFX returned as the full-time flagship station of the Titans Radio Network in 2010.
WGFX is the major Nashville-area affiliate for the University of Tennessee Volunteers football and men's basketball, The Vols moved to WGFX on 2010 after many years on WLAC. 
The station also broadcasts selected Belmont Bruins men's basketball games which do not conflict with the Vols.In the past, WGFX has served as the flagship station for the Nashville Predators (NHL, 2005–2010), Vanderbilt Commodores (SEC, 2004–2009), and Nashville Sounds (PCL, 2010–2011).
WGFX has previously served as the Nashville affiliate for The Jim Rome Show, The Dan Patrick Show, Sporting News Radio and ESPN Radio, and is currently on its second stint as an affiliate of Fox Sports Radio. It was announced that in 2013 the station would once again drop its Fox affiliation to be an affiliate of the upstart CBS Sports Radio network, but never did actually did so. Shortly afterwards, the CBS Sports Radio affiliation went to a competitor, WNSR, as WGFX retained the Fox Sports Radio affiliation.  However, WGFX also retains the hourly minute-long commentaries by CBSSR personalities such as Boomer Esiason and Doug Gottlieb.

Cumulus ownership
Following a bankruptcy, Citadel was acquired by Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. Shortly after the merger, WGFX and WKDF moved their studios from Rutledge Hill to Cumulus' existing cluster at Music Row, where they broadcast alongside WWTN, WSM-FM, and WQQK. WRQQ and WNFN also briefly shared studio space with WGFX until they were each sold to separate buyers.
Plaster, Daunic and McFarland left WGFX immediately after Cumulus acquired the station in September 2011, and the trio was instrumental in launching its primary competitor, WPRT-FM.
In 2017, WGFX removed all network programming during its weekday prime dayparts, focusing entirely on locally-produced shows.

Passage 10:
WJYM
WJYM (730 kHz) is an AM radio station licensed to Bowling Green, Ohio, and serving the Toledo metropolitan area. It broadcasts a Christian radio format, and is owned by the ministry of noted Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart. The studios and transmitter are on Freemont Pike (U.S. Route 20 - U.S. Route 23) near Lime City Road in Lime City, Ohio. 
By day, WJYM is powered at 1,000 watts.  But 730 AM is a Mexican and Canadian clear channel frequency.  So to avoid interference, at night WJYM reduces power to 359 watts.  It uses a directional antenna with a four-tower array.  Programming is also heard on 250-watt FM translator W295DB at 106.9 MHz.

History
Beginnings as WHRW
The station first signed on the air on December 1954 (1954-12).  The original call sign was WHRW, selected as the initials of its then-owner and founder, Howard R. Ward.  It was a daytimer with a power of 250 watts using two towers and required to go off the air at sunset.  Ward served as the president and general manager.  By the end of the 1950s, the station was given permission to increase its power to 1,000 watts, but still days only.  The studios were at the transmitter facility.
Ward was famous for stunting including a fight he had with General Telephone (GTE) concerning a teletype circuit which they could not provide to his station in rural Bowling Green.  Ward purchased an old truck and painted "WTLG Carrier Pigeon News Service" on the side.  He made a ceremony each day of driving it through the streets of Bowling Green to supposedly return his birds for dispatch of news releases out to his station from downtown. The local papers and wire services picked up on the story which embarrassed GTE. When GTE still would not budge he announced that he was giving away a free savings bond to the 10th caller to his station. He did not answer the phones during the contest and successfully locked up the GTE system in Bowling Green several times until the company obtained an injunction against him.
On July 1, 1961, Ward sold WHRW to H. Max Good.

As WMGS
After WHRW was sold to Good, the studios and offices were moved to the Waldorf Hotel in Toledo, as the recent power increase afforded the station with full market signal penetration.  The relocation to Toledo did not last long and the station returned to the Bowling Green area, taking space along Main Street. The call letters were then changed to WMGS, to reflect the positioning statement "with more good sounds", though some station insiders referred to "Max Good's Station" as the more accurate translation.
The station was silent until it moved to the present location in Lime City.  It returned to the air with 1,000 watts, days only, using four towers.  The Program Director was George Mishler who also hosted middays. The morning drive time DJ was Roy Blair, and the afternoon host was Jim Hamilton. The music was middle of the road (MOR).  When the format changed to country music, George Mishler went to work for the Voice of America (VOA) in Washington, D.C.  He ultimately became a manager of Special English programming. Jim Hamilton headed for Chicago, and Roy Blair went to Bowling Green State University to complete his B.A. in English. During this time, Roy announced for WFOB AM/FM, Fostoria and began work at WSPD AM after graduation. After WSPD AM, Roy was next heard on WJBK-TV 2, Detroit.
Under the country format, the DJs including Jim Bonnett as "Big Jim", who also was the station manager until 1966; Roger Price as "Pistol Pete" and program director from 1962 to 1966, Johnny Dauro as "Lonesome John" and manager from 1966 to 1970; Roy Blair as "Cousin Roy", George Lubgate as "Tiny Tim"; Ron Kitchen as "Ron the Dude" and program director in 1966; Lowell Thomas (Not the famous newscaster) as "L.T."; Bob Zrake as "Buffalo Bob"; Jerry Kiefer as program director in 1972; Earl Sharninghouse as "Rick Allen" and program director and Chief engineer from 1972 to 1973; Ken Robey as "Ken Roberts"; Dennis Rutherford as Chief engineer and part-time air talent in 1973; Klaus Helfers as "J.P. Jones"; and The Reverend Max Good, who preached daily.

As WJYM
On October 14, 1976, WMGS was sold to the Jimmy Swaggart Evangelistic Association, and became WJYM "Son Life Radio." The call letters are evocative of the name "Jim", after owner Jimmy Swaggart. For many years, the station operated locally with a full staff of approximately 12. In the mid 1990s, WJYM carried Bowling Green State University football and basketball games.
By 1980, the station's on-air operations moved to its transmitter facility along Fremont Pike in Rossford, where they remained for the rest of the 20th Century.  Advances made in hard-disk computer-based broadcast automation and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was passed, which relieved many stations of the main studio rule that required a studio and management presence within close proximity of the community of license.  At that point, on-air functions were moved to the ministry's headquarters in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Though station signage remains outside the transmitter facility, it is, for the most part, unattended.  Except for some computerized local announcements, WJYM is basically a simulcast of WJFM, the flagship station for Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.

History
This station began licensed operation in October 1948 as a 1,000-watt daytime-only station broadcasting at 800 kHz. Originally owned by North Alabama Broadcasting, the station was randomly assigned the WHOS call letters by the Federal Communications Commission; they do not stand for anything in particular. It ran a country music format for most of its first 40 years.
In February 1987, the broadcast license for WHOS was transferred from Dixie Broadcasting, Inc., to Dixie Broadcasting, Inc. as Debtor-In-Possession.  The transfer was approved by the FCC on February 26, 1987. Dixie Broadcasting had filed bankruptcy in an effort to stave off an adverse civil lawsuit outcome regarding the contracted sale of WDRM to W.H. Pollard, Jr., the then-owner of WBHP (1230 AM) in Huntsville, Alabama.In October 1988, the station, which had been airing a Southern Gospel music format, flipped to an all-Elvis Presley format using the advertising tagline "WHOS alive?". This novel format garnered the station national media attention, but failed to gain a local audience and lasted just six months, in effect a lengthy stunt. After the stunt ended, WHOS switched to a simulcast of then co-owned WDRM and its country music format, which was by this time very successful and on the verge of becoming North Alabama's top-rated station.
In January 1992, a deal was reached for the broadcast license for WHOS to be transferred from Dixie Broadcasting, Inc. as Debtor-In-Possession back to Dixie Broadcasting, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on March 26, 1992, and the transaction was consummated on September 15, 1992.In December 1991, Dixie Broadcasting, Inc., reached an agreement to merge ownership of this station with the ownership of WBHP to a new company named Mountain Lakes Broadcasting, Inc., pending the resolution of Dixie's legal difficulties.  In October 1993, with Dixie Broadcasting back in good financial standing and the legal issues settled by the appeals courts, the merger moved forward.  The deal was approved by the FCC on November 3, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on November 11, 1993.In November 1996, J. Mack Bramlett, W.H. Pollard Jr., and Trust B Under The Will Of W.H. Pollard Sr. reached an agreement to transfer control of Mountain Lakes Broadcasting, licensee of this station as well as WDRM and WBHP, to Osborn Communications Corporation.  The deal was approved by the FCC on January 29, 1997. In November 1997, WHOS and WBHP dropped their shared country music format for an all-news format featuring CNN Radio 24 hours a day.In August 1998, Osborn-owned Mountain Lakes Broadcasting, LLC, reached an agreement to sell this station to AMFM Inc. a subsidiary of Ameron Broadcasting Corporation.  The deal was approved by the FCC on October 2, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on November 5, 1998.In February 1999, AMFM Inc.'s Ameron Broadcasting Corporation made a deal to sell this station to Clear Channel Communications through its Capstar Royalty II Corporation subsidiary.  The deal was approved by the FCC on March 2, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on March 5, 1999. This deal, a small part of a larger $16.6 billion transaction, included all five of the Huntsville stations then in Clear Channel's Huntsville station group.

Former on-air staff
Notable former WHOS on-air staff included George Rose, who, along with his alter-ego "Cousin Josh" character, hosted "The Cousin Josh Jam-O-Ree" on several North Alabama radio stations in a career that began in 1948 and ended with his death in 2006.

Former programming
WHOS and sister station WBHP were the broadcast flagships for the 1999-2000 final season of the Huntsville Channel Cats and for the short-lived Huntsville Tornado for the 2000-2001 hockey season. Both teams played their home games at the Von Braun Center and competed in the Central Hockey League.

Minsk Region
Minsk Region, also known as Minsk Oblast or Minsk Voblasts (Belarusian: Мі́нская во́бласць, romanized: Minskaja voblasć, IPA: [ˈmʲinskaja ˈvobɫasʲtsʲ]; Russian: Минская о́бласть, romanized: Minskaya oblast), is one of the regions of Belarus. Its administrative center is Minsk, although it is a separate administrative territorial entity of Belarus. As of 2011, the region's population is 1,411,500.

Geography
Minsk Region covers a total of 39,900 km2, about 19.44% of the national total area. Lake Narach, the largest lake in the country, is located in the northern part of the region. There are four other large lakes in this region: Svir (8th largest), Myadel (11th largest), Syalyava (14th largest) and Myastro (15th largest). It is the only region of Belarus whose border is not part of the international border of Belarus.

History
Beginning the 10th century, the territory of the current Minsk Region was part of Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk, and later it was included in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the unification of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, the territory became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.
In 1793, as a result of the second partition of Polish territory, the area was annexed by Russia as the Minsk Region. During the collapse of the Russian Empire due to the Civil War, the western part was annexed to Poland in 1921, while the east became Soviet Belarus.
The Minsk region was established on 15 January 1938, based on the amendment of the Constitutional Law of the USSR. As of 20 February 1938, the area included 20 districts.  Following the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, 1939, the former Eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic were annexed in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact partitioning Poland and added to the Minsk Region.
On 20 September 1944, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck were removed from the Minsk region and transferred to the newly formed Bobruisk Region.
On 8 January 1954, by the decree of the USSR Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Nesvizhski and Stolbtsovsky districts from the abolished Baranovichi Region, as well as the Glusk, Gressky, Kopyl, Krasnoslobodski, Luban, Slutsky, Starobin, Starodorozhski districts and the city of Sluck from the abolished Bobruisk Region, were added to the Minsk Region.
In 1960, following the abolition of Molodechno Region, its southern part became the northern part of the Minsk Region.

Tourism
The number of travel agencies in Minsk Region grew from twelve in 2000 to seventy in 2010. The most popular tourist destinations of the region are Zaslavskoye Lake, the Zhdanovichi area which has health resorts, Nesvizh Palace and its surroundings, as well as the alpine ski resorts of Logoysk and Silichi.

Administrative subdivisions
The Minsk Region comprises 22 districts (raions), 307 selsovets, 22 cities, 8 city municipalities, and 20 urban-type settlements.

History
KFRU was founded in Bristow, Oklahoma by E.H. Rollestone, in January 1925. That fall, the station was purchased by Stephens College and moved to Columbia (with Rollestone going on to found KVOO, now KTSB).On September 24, 1935, the Federal Communications Commission approved transfer of the station from Nelson R. Darragh, of St. Louis, to Luther L. Hill, of Des Moines. Several owners later, the station was purchased by the St. Louis Star-Times newspaper, mostly for its regional broadcast frequency of 630 kHz, later moved to its St. Louis radio station, KXOK. In 1940, KFRU became an affiliate of the Blue Network. The station was assigned its current 1400 kHz frequency in 1941.
Mahlon Aldridge, Jr. was appointed manager in 1945, purchasing the station in 1948 in partnership with the publisher of the Columbia Daily Tribune. In 1957, the station's format consisted of a mixture of country music, news and sports.
Aldridge sold his interest to his partner's son in the 1980s, and competition caused the station's audience share to fall.  After another change in ownership, KFRU was purchased by a local ownership group headed by Al Germond, who moved the studios into the broadcast complex with their KARO-FM (now KPLA) station.  The group formed and purchased additional stations in the Columbia and Jefferson City markets under the name of Premier Marketing Group.
In 2004, KFRU and the other Premier Marketing Group stations were sold to Cumulus Broadcasting.  In August 2017, KFRU applied for an FM translator at 98.9 as part of the FCC's AM revitalization project.  The translator signed on for the first time on August 18, 2019.

Passage 17:
WKDM
WKDM (1380 AM) is a commercial radio station licensed to New York, New York. The station is owned by Multicultural Broadcasting and broadcasts on weekdays in Mandarin Chinese. Most shows are brokered programming, where the host pays for the time and may sell commercials to support the broadcasts. On weekends, programming switches to Spanish language Christian radio.
WKDM operates at 5,000 watts by day, using a directional antenna to protect other stations on 1380 AM.  After being granted a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit to increase night power, it operates at 13,000 watts after sunset, using a different directional pattern. The station's transmitter is located in Carlstadt, New Jersey.

History
The station began operation in 1926 as WBNX, the call letters reflecting the station's location in the borough of The Bronx. One of the station's first permanent homes was inside Starlight Park, an amusement park located on the east bank of the Bronx River just south of East 177th Street.  This tenancy lasted until 1932, when the Great Depression forced the park's closure, which then led to the station's eviction from its studios.WBNX changed frequencies several times during its early years, eventually finding a permanent home on 1380 kHz, sharing time on the frequency with religious broadcaster WAWZ in central New Jersey. It operated 18 hours a day with general entertainment and brokered programming.
In 1960 WBNX was sold to United Broadcasting. By the mid-1960s, WBNX was airing a Spanish contemporary music format during most of its hours, with some Jewish-oriented and Italian-language programming on weekends.
In 1984 the station changed the call letters to WKDM and became a full-time operation as United paid WAWZ owner Pillar of Fire to give up its portion of the time-share (WAWZ continued to operate on FM). It remained successful until the advent of a full-time Spanish language format on WSKQ-FM in 1989, which pulled away listeners. As a result, in the early 1990s the station began to carry more leased-access/brokered shows. In 1992 it went completely brokered, and was sold to Multicultural in 1994.
In 1999 Multicultural transferred WKDM to Mega Communications in exchange for cash and various Washington D.C. area stations.  Mega changed the call letters to WNNY and instituted an all news Spanish format (Noticas 1380). Eventually, the all-news evolved into a news/talk format.  This format was not successful, and by 2002 Mega had changed the call letters to WLXE and the format to Mexican pop music as "X-1380".  A few months later, Multicultural bought the station back and reinstated the WKDM call sign and the brokered programming policy.
Since 2007, WKDM has broadcast in Mandarin Chinese 24 hours a day Monday through Friday, featuring drama, popular music, talk shows, news program, children’s programs and sports, as well as programs from China and Taiwan.

History
In 1976, 107.3 FM belonged to WAJB, which was a beautiful music station with studios at the Tiger Point Country Club in Gulf Breeze, until it was purchased by Colonial Broadcasting in 1979.  The format was changed to country music along with new call letters, WOWW to become known as "WOW 107", moving its studios to Davis Highway in Pensacola.
As the 1980s progressed, "WOW 107" would rise up to become a country music power house, overthrowing the heritage country station in the market, WXBM-FM, and winning several Billboard Magazine's Station of the Year (small market) awards.  It was also known for its full-time News department, winner of multiple AP news awards.
As the 1980s ended, so did WOW 107's run of being a ratings king, now owned by Sun Media Group.  The 1990s saw several re-imaging attempts, including "The New WOW 107.3" and "107 Thunder Country", until its demise as a country station in 1995 when it became "New Rock One Zero Seven", flipping to alternative rock. Riding the popularity wave of mid-1990s alternative music, WOWW debuted at #1 in Arbitron's Persons 18-34, where it remained until the purchase and format flip by Paxson. "New Rock 107" staff included Steve Williams as Operations Manager/Morning Show host, Program Director/Midday host Joel Sampson, Music Director/Afternoon host LaLaine, and evening host Suzy Boe, among others.
In 1996, the station was purchased by Southern Broadcasting, which owned New Rock 107's only competition, WTKX, "TK101".  Two months later, both were purchased by Paxson Communications.  After the Paxson purchase, TK101, being a heritage rock station since the mid-1970s, brought over WOWW's PD Joel Sampson, retained Midday personality Mark "the Shark" Dyba and added a majority of WOWW air staff and re-imaged itself as "The Rock Station", dropping the moniker "The New Rock Alternative", leaving WOWW without an airstaff or a format.
After stunting for two days playing "Macarena" by Los del Rio non-stop, WOWW changed formats to oldies from the 1950s and 1960s, and changed its call letters to WYCL (which stood for "Way Cool").  As time went on, they phased out the 1950s music to include more 1970s songs.

Then, in late 2004, the station's owner, now iHeartMedia, Inc. (formerly Clear Channel Communications), switched the format to "My 107.3", and played 1970s and 1980s music.  However, the "My 70s, My 80s" positioner was discontinued and the station used "My Variety" as its main positioner, in order to include a slightly wider variety of music.  The playlist remained mostly 1970s and early 1980s, with a fair amount of 1960s and other 1980s songs, making it a classic hits format.
For three years after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the station played breaking news bulletins every hour on top of the hour (first provided by ABC News, then by Clear Channel Worldwide News), as well as "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the start and close of each workday.

In February 2010, the station ceased the "My 107.3" format and began simulcasting sister station WMXC. On February 26, 2010, at 8:00 a.m., WYCL flipped to rhythmic adult contemporary format, branded as "107.3 The Groove". The first song on The Groove was "Into the Groove" by Madonna. On March 5, 2010, WYCL changed their call letters to WRGV to go with "The Groove" branding. After a year as a Rhythmic AC, WRGV evolved to Rhythmic Top 40 in April 2011. On September 2, 2011, WRGV changed their format to Top 40 (CHR), branded as "107.3 Hit Music Now". It featured the syndicated Elvis Duran Morning Show and former WABB staffers Reid and Matt McCoy. On July 20, 2015, WRGV rebranded as "107.3 Kiss FM".On December 8, 2017, at 5 p.m., after playing "1-800-273-8255" by Logic featuring Alessia Cara and Khalid, WRGV adopted W262BL/WMXC-HD2's urban contemporary format as "107.3 The Beat". The first song on "The Beat" was "Love" by Kendrick Lamar featuring Zacari.
