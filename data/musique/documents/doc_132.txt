Passage 1:
Randall Munroe
Randall Patrick Munroe (born October 17, 1984) is an American cartoonist, author, and engineer best known as the creator of the webcomic xkcd. Munroe has worked full-time on the comic since late 2006. In addition to publishing a book of the webcomic's strips, he has written four books: What If?, Thing Explainer, How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems, and What If? 2.

Early life
Munroe was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, and his father has worked as an engineer and marketer. He has two younger siblings, including a brother named Doug, and was raised as a Quaker. He was a fan of comic strips in newspapers from an early age, starting off with Calvin and Hobbes. After graduating from the Chesterfield County Mathematics and Science High School at Clover Hill in Midlothian, Virginia, he graduated from Christopher Newport University in 2006 with a degree in physics.

Career
NASA
Munroe worked as a contract programmer and roboticist for NASA at the Langley Research Center, before and after his graduation with a physics degree. In late 2006, he left NASA and moved to Boston to focus on webcomics full time.

Webcomic
Munroe's webcomic, entitled xkcd, is primarily a stick figure comic. Its tagline describes it as "A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language".Munroe had originally used xkcd as an instant messaging screenname because he wanted a name without a meaning so he would not eventually grow tired of it. He registered the domain name, but left it idle until he started posting his drawings, perhaps in September 2005. The webcomic quickly became very popular, garnering up to 70 million hits a month by October 2007. Munroe has said, "I think the comic that's gotten me the most feedback is actually the one about the stoplights".Munroe now supports himself by the sale of xkcd-related merchandise, primarily thousands of t-shirts a month. He licenses his xkcd creations under the Creative Commons attribution-noncommercial 2.5, stating that it is not just about the free culture movement, but that it also makes good business sense.In 2010, he published a collection of the comics. He has also toured the lecture circuit, giving speeches at places such as Google's Googleplex in Mountain View, California.The popularity of the strip among science fiction fans resulted in Munroe being nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist in 2011 and again in 2012. In 2014, he won the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story for the xkcd strip "Time".

Other projects
Munroe is the creator of the now defunct websites "The Funniest", "The Cutest", and "The Fairest", each of which presents users with two options and asks them to choose one over the other.In January 2008, Munroe developed an open-source chat moderation script named "Robot9000". Originally developed to moderate one of Munroe's xkcd-related Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels, the software's algorithm attempts to prevent repetition in IRC channels by temporarily muting users who send messages that are identical to a message that has been sent to the channel before. If users continue to send unoriginal messages, Robot9000 mutes the user for a longer period, quadrupling for each unoriginal message the user sends to the channel. Shortly after Munroe's blog post about the script went live, 4chan administrator Christopher Poole adapted the script to moderate the site's experimental /r9k/ board. Twitch trialed R9K mode but it did not pass beta.In October 2008, The New Yorker magazine online published an interview and "Cartoon Off" between Munroe and Farley Katz, in which each cartoonist drew a series of four humorous cartoons.In early 2010, Munroe ran the xkcd Color Name Survey, in which participants were shown a series of RGB colors and asked to enter a suitable name for each specific color. Munroe wanted to identify colors which were given identical or highly similar names by a large number of survey participants, which would then serve as an approximate list of the most common colors rendered similarly across a range of computer monitors. Over 200,000 people eventually completed the survey, and Munroe published the resulting list of 954 named RGB web colors on the xkcd website. They have since been adopted as conventional color identifiers in various programming and markup languages, including Python and LaTeX.

What If?
Munroe has a blog entitled What If?, where he has answered questions sent in by fans of his comics. These questions are usually absurd and related to math or physics, and he explains them using both his knowledge and various academic sources. In 2014, he published a collection of some of the responses, as well as a few new ones and some rejected questions, in a book entitled What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions. Starting in November 2019, Munroe began writing a monthly column in the New York Times titled Good Question, answering user-submitted questions in the same style as What If.
A sequel, What If? 2: Additional Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions, was published in September 2022.

Radioactivity visualization
In response to concerns about the radioactivity released by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, and to remedy what he described as "confusing" reporting on radiation levels in the media, Munroe created a radiation chart of comparative radiation exposure levels. The chart was rapidly adopted by print and online journalists in several countries, including being linked to by online writers for The Guardian, and The New York Times. As a result of requests for permission to reprint the chart and to translate it into Japanese, Munroe placed it in the public domain, but requested that his non-expert status be clearly stated in any reprinting.Munroe published an xkcd-style comic on scientific publishing and open access in Science in October 2013.

Thing Explainer
Munroe's book Thing Explainer, announced in May 2015 and published later that year, explains concepts using only the 1,000 most common English words. The book's publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, saw these illustrations as potentially useful for textbooks, and announced in March 2016 that the next editions of their high-school-level chemistry, biology, and physics textbooks will include selected drawings and accompanying text from Thing Explainer.

How To
In February 2019, Munroe announced his next book, How To, which was released in September of that year. The book deals with everyday problems by using physics to find absurd, and generally extreme, solutions to them.

Influence
In September 2013, Munroe announced that a group of xkcd readers had submitted his name as a candidate for the renaming of asteroid (4942) 1987 DU6 to 4942 Munroe. The name was accepted by the International Astronomical Union.

Personal life
As of May 2008, Munroe lives in Somerville, Massachusetts.In October 2010, Munroe's fiancée was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer; there had been no prior family history. The emotional effect of her illness was referenced in the comic panel "Emotion", published 18 months later in April 2012. In September 2011, he announced that they had married. In November 2012, he published a comic entitled "Two Years', and in December 2017, Munroe followed this with a comic entitled "Seven Years". He revisited the subject in November 2020 in a comic entitled "Ten Years".His hobbies and interests include kite photography, in which cameras are attached to kites and photographs are then taken of the ground or buildings.

Reception
Living Out Loud received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 59% rating based on 34 reviews. The site's consensus states: "Unoriginal, with one-dimensional characters." On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 64% based on reviews from 24 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade "B−" on scale of A to F.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars and wrote that he enjoyed that the movie provided "the comfort of these lives flowing briefly in the same stream. The sense that the unexpected was free to enter the story, and would not be shouldered aside by the demands of conventional plotting."  Ebert gave particular praise to writer and director Richard LaGravenese, who he wrote is "more interested in characters and dialogue than in shaping everything into a conventional story.  He aims for the kind of bittersweet open ends that life itself so often supplies; he doesn't hammer his square pegs into round holes." Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune also gave the film a positive review, but noted that the "story also has a tendency to wander, which enhances the slice-of-life feel but at the expense of the movie feeling fully formed."  The New York Times critic Janet Maslin was less favorable, writing that LaGravenese "has borrowed from Chekhov the soul-baring introspection that can be so ineffable on the page or stage yet becomes so damply sensitive and dramatically vague on the screen" and, in describing some of the "wild flights of fancy springing from Judith's imagination," observed that "free-spirited as the film hopes to be, it can't easily reconcile such flamboyant departures with an otherwise static pace." Maslin credited Latifah as the film's "one big saving grace," and also offered praise for DeVito for "turning Pat into a three-dimensional figure and singing They Can't Take That Away from Me with brio on the nightclub's amateur night."

Passage 7:
Growing Up American
Growing Up American: How Vietnamese Children Adapt to Life in the United States, by Min Zhou and Carl L. Bankston III is one of the most influential books on the Vietnamese American experience. Published in 1998 by the Russell Sage Foundation, it is widely used in college classes on international migration, contemporary American history, and Asian Studies. The book emphasizes the role of Vietnamese communities in promoting the adaptation of Vietnamese American young people. 
One of the unique characteristics of the book is its combination of a general history of the growth and nature of Vietnamese American communities around the United States with an in-depth study of one specific Vietnamese community, on the eastern edge of New Orleans, Louisiana.

Organization of the book
Chapter 1 traces the history of Vietnamese settlement in the United States, giving special attention to how the process of refugee resettlement and popular opinions of the American public have influenced Vietnamese American children. Chapter 2 gives a description of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the U.S. Vietnamese population and describes the social and economic challenges facing the Vietnamese. Chapter 3 offers examples of how families and surrounding ethnic communities can serve as sources of social capital for young people. Chapter 4 discusses the patterns of social and kinship relations in Vietnamese ethnic communities. Here, Zhou and Bankston develop their theory that ethnic social relations can serve as a form of social capital for young people growing up in immigrant communities. Chapter 5 examines how Vietnamese language abilities promote the adaptation of young Vietnamese to American society by connecting them to the supports of their families and communities. Chapter 6 considers Vietnamese American adaptation to American schools and argues that generally high levels of school performance are products of tightly integrated ethnic communities. Chapter 7 examines bicultural conflict and gender role issues faced by Vietnamese growing up in the United States. Chapter 8 discusses peer group associations and problems of juvenile delinquency. It provides evidence that young people who follow delinquent patterns tend to be those who assimilate to the youth culture of Vietnamese and other subgroups, rather than remain bound within their ethnic communities. Chapter 9 gives a general summary and offers conclusions of relevance to the study of immigrant and minority groups in the United States.

Critical reception
Growing Up American has received widespread critical praise. Writing in the journal Social Forces, reviewer Jiannbin Shiao described the analysis of delinquency in the Vietnamese community as “contestable but refreshingly bold” and described it as “a fine contribution to the sociology of education, social stratification, social demography, Asian American Studies, and, one hopes, also U.S. urban policy.” In the International Migration Review, Kimberly Goyette praised the book for “…elaborat[ing] a detailed and elegant framework for conceptualizing the relationship between children and their various environments and also the relationship between these environments.” Kelly Chong, reviewing the book for the American Journal of Sociology, observed “this comprehensive investigation of the adaptation process of second generation Vietnamese in the United States fills an important gap in the study of contemporary “new” immigrants and the second generation assimilation experience.”
In addition to the praise, though, reviewers have also had some reservations. In particular, critics have questioned the generalizability of the books findings to other ethnic groups and they have suggested the book may be too optimistic in its account of the future of young Vietnamese Americans. Critics of more radical orientations have often objected the authors’ acceptance of American society and the focus on adapting to that society. For example, Karin Aguilar-San Juan, in the book Little Saigons: Staying Vietnamese in America, accuses Zhou and Bankston of ignoring the processes of racialization and systemic racism in encouraging Asian immigrant achievement while frustrating black American achievement.

Passage 8:
The Loud House
The Loud House is an American animated television series created by Chris Savino that premiered on Nickelodeon on May 2, 2016. The series revolves around the chaotic everyday life of a boy named Lincoln Loud, who is the middle child and only son in a large family of 11 children. It is set in a fictional town in southeastern Michigan called Royal Woods, based on Savino's hometown of Royal Oak. The series was pitched to the network in 2013 as a two-minute short film entered in the annual Animated Shorts Program. It entered production the following year. The series is based on Savino's own childhood growing up in a large family, and its animation is largely influenced by newspaper comic strips.
Since its debut, the series has gained high ratings, becoming the top-rated children's animated series on American television within its first month on the air. The series has received considerable media attention and nominations at both the 28th and the 29th GLAAD Media Awards for its inclusion of Howard and Harold McBride, two supporting characters who are an interracial gay married couple. Their introduction into the series was reported in the news as being historic and caused a ratings surge. In May 2017, the characters of Lincoln Loud and Clyde McBride were featured on the front cover of Variety as an example of diverse characters in children's television.As of May 2023, seven seasons of the series have been broadcast. The series has spawned a multimedia franchise, including the spin-off series The Casagrandes, which aired from October 2019 to September 2022, an animated feature film that was released on Netflix in August 2021, a live-action television film that premiered in November 2021, and live-action series The Really Loud House that premiered in November 2022. Additionally, a second live-action television film is in development, set to premiere in fall 2023.

Premise
Lincoln Loud is the only boy and the middle child in a family of eleven children residing in the fictional town of Royal Woods, Michigan. He has ten sisters with distinctive personalities consisting of bossy eldest child Lori, ditzy fashionista Leni, musician Luna, comedian Luan, athletic Lynn Jr., gloomy poetic goth Lucy, polar opposite twins Lana and Lola, child genius Lisa, and baby Lily. Lincoln occasionally breaks the fourth wall to explain to the viewers the chaotic conditions and sibling relationships of the household, and continually devises plans to make his life in the Loud House better.
During the first four seasons, Lori, Leni, Luna, and Luan were in high school, Lynn was in middle school, and Lincoln, Lucy, Lana, Lola, and Lisa were in elementary school. In the fifth season, the Loud siblings aged up a year with Lori going to Fairway University, Lincoln going to middle school, and Lily going to preschool.

Episodes
Production
Development
The Loud House was created by Chris Savino for Nickelodeon. Savino based the series on his own experiences growing up in a large family. Early in development, the Loud family was going to be composed of rabbits, but this was terminated when an executive, Jenna Boyd, asked Savino to make them human. The idea of the Loud family being rabbits became used as Lincoln's dream in the Season 3 episode "White Hare". He pitched the idea to Nickelodeon in 2013 as a 2+1⁄2-minute short for their annual Animated Shorts Program. In June 2014, Nickelodeon announced that The Loud House had been picked up for a season of 13 episodes. The episode order was later increased to 26. On May 25, 2016, Nickelodeon announced that the series had been picked up for a second season of 14 episodes later increased to 26. On October 19, 2016, the series had been picked up for a third season of 26 episodes. Savino has cited Peanuts and Polly and Her Pals as influences on the show's characterizations and animation. Newspaper comic strips are also influences on the show's background art.
Episodes are produced at Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, USA and animated by Canadian studio Jam Filled Entertainment.

Savino's firing
On October 17, 2017, Cartoon Brew reported that Chris Savino was suspended from the studio due to allegations of sexual harassment, the report noting that rumors of Savino's behavior have existed for "at least a decade." On October 19, a Nickelodeon spokesperson confirmed that Savino had been fired from the studio, and that the series will continue production without him. Six days later on October 23, Savino spoke for the first time since his firing saying he said he was "deeply sorry" for his actions. Alongside the announcement of the series being greenlit for a fourth season, it was revealed that story editor Michael Rubiner had now been named executive producer and showrunner. On May 30, 2018, Savino was suspended from The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839, for one year.

Broadcast
The series debuted on Nickelodeon on May 2, 2016, with new episodes premiering every weekday that month. The first trailer for the series premiered on March 13, 2016. The series also aired on AFN Family.

Home media
Reception
Critical
The Loud House has received positive reviews, specifically for its animation, voice acting, characterization, and the heartwarming themes of each episode. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media praised the show's voice cast and thematic messages, writing that "kids will come to The Loud House for the laughs, but they'll return for the ensemble cast and the surprisingly heartwarming themes that dominate every story." Kevin Johnson of The A.V. Club gave the series a B+, noting that "the female characters are defined by their traits, but never judged for them."It attracted negative attention from some fans and critics later on for its heavy amount of spin-offs and merchandising. Ryan Lewis of CBR.com wrote that "Nickelodeon tried too hard to match SpongeBob's influence and immediately took to creating spin-offs, a Netflix movie, and countless merchandise. These efforts may have been justified had The Loud House not been written with one-note stock characters making up its main cast."

LGBTQIA+ representation
The characters of Howard and Harold McBride have received praise for being a positive representation of an interracial gay married couple. They are the first married gay couple to be featured in a Nicktoon. Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair stated that The Loud House "handles the topic [of same-sex marriage] in exactly the right way...this kind of casual representation in children's programming is a milestone." De Elizabeth of Teen Vogue wrote, "The best part is that the show doesn't treat these characters any differently, or even introduce them with a heavy asterisk about their marital status." The Frisky's Tai Gooden mentioned that "kids who have two dads (or moms) will be more than thrilled to see a family they can identify with on TV." Time reported that "people are thrilled about Nickelodeon's decision" to include a gay couple. Some conservative groups, by contrast, have criticized the introduction of the characters. The One Million Moms division of the American Family Association objected to scenes featuring the McBride parents and unsuccessfully pushed for the episode in which they first appeared to be edited to exclude the couple, saying that "Nickelodeon should stick to entertaining instead of pushing an agenda." The Kenya Film Classification Board also called for the suspension of the series on pay television service DStv, saying that the animated series "promotes the Lesbian, Gay and Transgender agenda."
Kenya's film and classification board (KFCB) has called for the suspension of several US-produced children's programs running on channels provided by TV company MultiChoice. The board said the cartoons featured "disturbing content glorifying homosexual behavior" which was not suitable for children.
The animation programs are The Loud House, The Legend of Korra, and Hey Arnold, which run on the Nickelodeon channel, and Clarence, Steven Universe, and Adventure Time which air on Cartoon Network.
...

It's wasn't immediately clear if the supposedly offending Nickelodeon episodes ever aired in Kenya. Viacom Africa, which licenses the Nickelodeon shows said last July it would not be airing such shows in South Africa and the rest of sub Saharan Africa.

Ratings
The Loud House became the number-one children's animated series on television within its first month on the air. Throughout May 2016, it received an average of 68% more viewers in its target audience of children aged 6–11 than broadcasts on Nickelodeon in May of the previous year. As of June 2016, it was Nickelodeon's highest-rated program, beating SpongeBob SquarePants with an average Nielsen rating of 4.9 among the 2–11 demographic at the time.The Los Angeles Times cited The Loud House as a major factor in maintaining Nickelodeon's position as the highest-rated children's network in summer 2016. During the show's fourth week of premieres, Cyma Zarghami announced that it was continuing to draw more viewers than any other program on the channel.The show's highest-rated episode, with 2.28 million viewers upon its premiere, is "Two Boys and a Baby". This was the first episode to air after it was announced that Howard and Harold McBride would be debuting on the program. The first episode of The Loud House shown at prime time, "11 Louds a Leapin'", was the seventh most-viewed telecast across all U.S. households on November 25, 2016.

The series has also been nominated for Favorite Cartoon at the Kids' Choice Awards every year since 2017.

Luna Loud – Luna and her roadie Chunk give the listeners a virtual tour of Luna's home music studio (which is actually her and Luan's bedroom) where Luna talks about her musical instruments and her inspirations, but some of her instruments keep disturbing Bud Grouse.

Lori Loud – With Bobby on her phone helping out from Great Lakes City and Luna providing musical accompaniment, he and Lori talk about how they first met and eventually started dating. However, they over-romanticize the details on their first date so Luan and Lynn Jr. chime in and tell them what really happened and how they had spied on them during the date to make sure that Bobby was good for Lori.
Lincoln Loud – Lincoln and Clyde give the listeners a virtual tour of their treehouse. When their hammock goes missing, Lincoln and Clyde become Ace Savvy and One-Eyed Jack to find out who stole it.

Episodes
Production
This was one of the few failures from Aaron Spelling's production company in its history, since it was picked by ABC to debut right after the Super Bowl in 1985 and was heavily promoted  during the game. The promotion resulted in high ratings at first, but the series was cancelled three months into its run. The ratings decline was blamed on ABC's repeated changing of the show's timeslot before settling on Monday nights at 10:00 p.m., known as "the graveyard slot". It ranked 36th out of 77 shows with a 14.9 rating and a 23 share.Because of the frequent commercials during the Super Bowl, the following night Johnny Carson asked rhetorically during his monologue on The Tonight Show, "Did you see that new show, 'Frequent and Loud'?"The series was rushed into production by ABC in order to capitalize on the popularity of another crime drama at that time, Cagney & Lacey (which aired on CBS).

Passage 12:
Scorpion Swamp
Scorpion Swamp is a single-player adventuring gamebook written by Steve Jackson (the American game designer, as opposed to the series co-creator), illustrated by Duncan Smith and originally published in 1984 by Puffin Books. It forms part of Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy series. It is the 8th in the series in the original Puffin series (ISBN 0-14-031829-1). It was the first Fighting Fantasy book to be written by an author other than the co-creators of the series.

Rules
Story
Scorpion Swamp is a fantasy scenario. Having acquired a magical Brass Ring (which detects evil and always indicates which direction is north) from a mysterious old woman, the player enters the notorious Scorpion Swamp.
Gameplay differed from previous titles in several ways:

The story allows the player to choose one of three quests: the patrons of said quests being either good (locate a rare plant for the wizard Selator), evil (acquire the amulets of animal/insect avatars for the wizard Grimslade) or neutral (map a trade route for the trader Poomchukker) respectively.
Gameplay has a non-linear design, allowing "free roaming": the player may explore the swamp at will and return to locations previously visited.
The game design employed a grid system of locations to explore. Whereas in previous titles choosing an option to follow a point of the compass was nebulous and backtracking almost impossible, in this title each location was equidistant from all others and options only led in the four primary compass directions. On entering a location, the player was asked if they had visited previously, and instructed accordingly. This format was an innovation for Fighting Fantasy.
The 400th reference does not contain an ending to the adventure.

Ilyasah Shabazz
Ilyasah Shabazz (born July 22, 1962) is an American author, most notably of a memoir, Growing Up X, community organizer, social activist, and motivational speaker, and the third daughter of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz.

Early life
Shabazz was born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 22, 1962. She was named after Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam, the religious and Black nationalist group to which her parents belonged. Shabazz is of African-American, African-Grenadian, English and Scottish descent. 
In February 1965, when she was two years old, Shabazz was present, with her mother and sisters, at the assassination of her father. She says she has no memory of the event.Shabazz had an apolitical upbringing in a racially integrated neighborhood in Mount Vernon, New York. Her family never took part in demonstrations or attended rallies. Together with her sisters, she joined Jack and Jill, a social club for the children of well-off African Americans. She considered an acting career, though her mother was not supportive.
